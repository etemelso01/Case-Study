<h1 align="center">Positioning in the Five Forces Framework</h1>

<p><strong>Threat of New Entrants:</strong> The automotive industry has high barriers to entry due to capital-intensive production, established brand loyalty, and advanced technology needs. However, emerging startups with AI-focused technologies (e.g., electric vehicle manufacturers like Tesla) are becoming formidable competitors.</p>

<p><strong>Bargaining Power of Suppliers:</strong> VW relies on various suppliers for materials, components, and AI technology, which gives some bargaining power to key suppliers. However, VW’s size and global presence offer leverage in negotiating contracts.</p>

<p><strong>Bargaining Power of Buyers:</strong> Consumers have increasing bargaining power due to the wide array of vehicle options available, driven by technological advancements and changing preferences, particularly in terms of electric and autonomous vehicles. AI offers VW an opportunity to stand out with unique features that improve the driving experience.</p>

<p><strong>Threat of Substitute Products:</strong> The threat of substitutes is growing, particularly in terms of alternative mobility solutions such as shared transportation and autonomous vehicles. AI helps mitigate this by enabling VW to develop cutting-edge, self-driving, and connected vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>Industry Rivalry:</strong> Rivalry is high, with companies like Tesla, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz all pushing the envelope on electric and autonomous vehicle technologies. AI is key to gaining a competitive edge in this highly competitive landscape.</p>
